<h1 id="working-with-types">Working with types</h1>

<p>Whenever working in BLOBAs, the domains are quite different (unless you are tasked to write yet-another-shopping-cart-like-we-do-in-this-lab), but the patterns of breaking down that domain and implementing it are the same.</p>
<p>From a data standpoint, modeling a domain boils down to the following problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Defining <strong>simple values</strong></li>
<li>Creating complex types with AND (<a class="xref" href="../addendum/products.html">product types</a>)</li>
<li>Creating complex types with OR (<a class="xref" href="../addendum/sum-types.html">sum types</a>)</li>
<li>Creating workflows</li>
</ol>
<p>In this particular article we're going to focus on how can we segregate the basic types with respect to a domain.</p>
<h2 id="simple-values">Simple values</h2>
<p>Simple values are the cornerstone of modeling a domain, and probably the most overlooked technique when using a mainstream language that doesn't advertise a proper usage of the type system.
The issue here is that most of the time using primitives is very, very convenient, and we rarely see this approach discouraged. Given the fact that we are in a 'shopping-cart' domain, which is backed by some sort of a database, the notion of a <code>CustomerId</code> is usually translated into a simple <code>int</code> (or <code>long</code>).</p>
<p>As we stated in the <a class="xref" href="../addendum/basic-types.html">basic data types as sets</a>, that all <code>email addresses</code> are <code>strings</code>, but not all <code>strings</code> are <code>email addresses</code>, the same applies here. All <code>CustomerIds</code> are <code>int</code>, but not all <code>int</code> are <code>CustomerId</code>. Which can lead to the following scenario:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">let customerId: int = 42
let findCustomer(customerId: int): Customer = failwith &quot;We shall ignore implementation&quot;
let findOrder(orderId: int): Order = failwith &quot;We shall ignore implementation&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>In the previous code I just assumed that we don't know anything about this primitive abuse, and we've just defined a variable that is <code>named</code> customerId (actually, this is the only domain reference that we are going to use) and then implemented two simple functions that take as an argument a <code>customerId</code> and an <code>orderId</code>. Both of them <code>int</code>. Then I can do this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">findCustomer(customerId) //compiler is happy
findOrder(customerId)  //compiler is also happy
</code></pre>
<p>See the problem in the code above? The compiler doesn't really care that I've <code>named</code> a variable in a particular way, embedding domain knowledge into the naming conventions (which is something that <code>we have to do</code>), it only cares about the types that I've specified as arguments. Both of them are <code>int</code>. If I send a <code>customerId</code> instead of an <code>orderId</code>, yeah, it's going to be happy.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>A couple of years ago while being on C# I've ended up into this situation, by mistakenly swapping two identifiers that were using really close naming conventions that got overlooked on Pull Requests. That ended up in a huge data corruption that had to be manually fixed. This was just human error that the compiler was blind to.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="how-can-we-fix-this">How can we fix this?</h3>
<p>As stated before, not all <code>int</code>s are <code>customerId</code>s, let's just create a simple wrapper type that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tags the correct type.</li>
<li>Is able to encapsulate the creation of those simple values using Smart constructors (TODO)</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">type CustomerId =
    | CustomerId of int

let customerId: CustomerId = CustomerId(42)
let findCustomer(customerId: CustomerId): Customer = failwith &quot;We shall ignore implementation&quot;
let findOrder(orderId: OrderId): Order = failwith &quot;We shall ignore implementation&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Ok, we've lifted those two functions to take the <code>type tag</code> as an argument, therefore the following invocations:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">findCustomer(customerId) //compiler is happy
findOrder(customerId)  //compiler is NOT happy
</code></pre>
<p>In a language with proper type system support, this approach should not be cumbersome to use. Should have the same level of complexity as with using primitives. I tend to believe that the advantages are quite obvious.</p>
<h2 id="for-product-types">For <code>product</code> types...</h2>
<p>...I highly recommend going through <a class="xref" href="../addendum/products.html">the product types article</a>, which also contains examples and other computer science references.</p>
<h2 id="for-sum-types">For <code>sum</code> types...</h2>
<p>...I highly recommend going through <a class="xref" href="../addendum/sum-types.html">the sum types article</a>, which also contains examples and other computer science references.</p>
<h1 id="identity">Identity</h1>
<p>We know know what's the basic modus-operandi for handling data types, let's see how can we segregate them from a domain perspective. This is not a matter of implementation, it's a matter of how we reason about the concepts that we aim to represent through those data types. The question is: does whatever I want to represent via a data type has <code>identity</code> or not.</p>
<p>In DDD, objects with a persistent identity are called <code>entities</code> and objects without a persistent identity are called <code>values</code>.</p>
<h2 id="value-objects">Value objects</h2>
<p>In order to get <code>identity</code> right, we can try to reason about it in terms of <code>equality</code>. Let's say, for example, that in my <code>shopping cart</code> domain I define the notion of a <code>product code</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">type ProductCode = 
    | ProductCode of string
let productCode1 = ProductCode(&quot;Adibas&quot;)
let productCode2 = ProductCode(&quot;Adibas&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Are <code>productCode1</code> and <code>productCode2</code> equal? Well, from an implementation perspective they are, because this is how the type system works.</p>
<p>Let's rephrase that: are <code>productCode1</code> and <code>productCode2</code> <code>interchangable</code>? Do they influence my <code>domain</code> in any way, shape or form if I use one instead of the other given they have the same value? The answer is yes, those two <code>values</code> are interchangeable.</p>
<p>Usually <code>value</code> types are just <code>basic types</code> used to build entities. However, don't confuse <code>values</code> with <code>single union tag</code>, like we used in an example from above. We can have value types expressed as either <code>product</code> or <code>sum</code> types. An example from Scott Wlaschin's book:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">let address1 = {StreetAddress = &quot;123 Main St&quot;; City = &quot;New York&quot;; Zip=&quot;90001&quot;}
let address2 = {StreetAddress = &quot;123 Main St&quot;; City = &quot;New York&quot;; Zip=&quot;90001&quot;}
printfn &quot;%b&quot; (address1 = address2) //will print 'true'
</code></pre>
<p>You shouldn't identify a persistent identity in those two objects.</p>
<h2 id="entities">Entities</h2>
<p>When things start to become a bit more complex, and we start to get closer to the real world, objects start to require <code>identity</code>. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>If an order is altered behind the scenes because one of the items is no longer available. Does the previous instance of the order and the new instance of the order <code>represent</code> different things? No. They're still the same order.</li>
<li>If a customer changes his billing address, is it a different customer? No. From a domain perspective it represents the same thing.</li>
<li>The example from the course: describing an <code>apple</code> it's just a value. If that <code>apple</code> gains the property of ownership (i.e. it's <code>my apple</code>), then that <code>has</code> to be viewed through the lenses of an <code>entity</code>.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">type Order =
    { Id: OrderId
      CustomerId: CustomerId
      ShippingAddress: ShippingAddress
      BillingAddress: BillingAddress
      OrderLines: OrderLine list 
    }
</code></pre>
